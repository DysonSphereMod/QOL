# MultiBuild

This mods gives you the ability to build multiple copies of a building, with optional space between the copies.
It also allow you to create / restore/ export/ import blueprints, allowing you to copy and paste whole parts of your base

Visit the amazing website created by `Diacred` [https://www.dysonsphereblueprints.com](https://www.dysonsphereblueprints.com) to view and share blueprints!

This mod is **NOT COMPATIBLE** with AdvancedBuildDestruct and Copyinserters, but that shouldn't be a problem as this mod provides the same functionalities (multibuild, copy of inserters, etc).

The mod will not initialise if any of the incompatible mods are loaded. please remove them from your modman profile or from your plugins (if you are installing mods manually)

## Beta Notice

This version is under development and cannot , yet, be considered fully stable. It should not affect in any destructive manner your savegame, but you might experience some 'weirdness' and graphic glitches when using this mod. 

Please carefully read the limitation of the current beta version of this mod.


## Disclaimer

**This mod does not alter any entity or save anything to disk.**  
This mean the mod SHOULD be very safe to use and not break your savegame, not even after an update.  
If it stops working following a game update, you can just disable it and your game will just work, obviously without the extended capabilities provided by the mod.


## Usage


### MultiBuild Mode
Select a building from the building bar or copy an exisiting building, then press `LEFT ALT` keyboard button to enter multibuild mode.

This mode is disabled while holding a blueprint (for now).

- `Left Mouse Click` once to start building and `Left Mouse Click` one more time when you are happy with the placement of the copies.
- Press `TAB` to toggle the pasting of the copied inserters
- Press `+` and `-` on your keyboard to increase / decrease the spacing between buildings
- Press `CTRL +` and `CTRL -` on your keyboard to increase / decrease the spacing period (number of copied before adding a space)
- Press `0` to reset spacing to 0 and spacing period to 1
- Press `Z` to 'rotate' the building path (if you are not buildin on a straight line)


### Blueprint Mode

Click the blueprint button in the build dock

- The first button initiate the creation of a new blueprint
  - `left click` (and hold if you want) to add entities to the blueprint
  - hold `CTRL` and `left click` (and hold if you want) to remove entities from the blueprint
  - `right click` to exit blueprint creation mode
- The second button restore the last used blueprint 
- The 3rd button exports the current blueprint to your clipboard 
- The 4th button import the data from your clipboard into your blueprint

### Inserter copy functionality
When `shift+click` an exisisting building it will be copied with all the connected insters (creating a minimal blueprint , that you can store and reload);

## Configuration

### itemSpecificSpacing
> If this option is set to true, the mod will remember the last spacing used for a specific building. Otherwise the spacing will be the same for all entities.
- `Type: boolean [true/false]`
- `Default value : true`

## FAQ

- **What are the limitations of this mod (MultiBuild mode)?**  
  This mod doens't allow to place multiple miners, oil extractors or orbital collectors. 


- **What are the limitations of this mod (Blueprint mode)?**  
  This mod is still in development and so has one or more know issue:
  - in some conditions, when pasting a blueprint, it's possible to place building nearer than what is possible in vanilla
  - splitter / boxes settings are not copied

## TODO

- Add ability to build a full 'loop' of a certain type of building. useful to build a lot of solar panels.
  
## Changelog

### v2.1.4-Beta
- Fix error when hovering a multilevel tank while holding a belt in hand

### v2.1.3-Beta
- Fix issue with colliders in multibuild mode where shift+clicking a rotated entity and using multibuild mode was leading to either too spaced or not spaced enough copies (the collider of the copies was not correctly rotated)
- Fix issue that allowed to connect inserter to building without inserter slots (like tesla towers for example), when copying building with attached inserters

### v2.1.2-Beta
- Allow to import blueprintV1 ! (thanks `Kremnev8`)
- fix edge case bug that could led to belt not correctly connecting to tanks / splitter / logistic towers 
- Add checks for incompatible items (modded items) when loading a blueprint

### v2.1.1-Beta
- Allow to copy / paste elevated belts (multilevel buildings are still ignored even if they appear as selected)
- Allow to connect blueprinted belts with existing ones (only at belt extremities and direction must, obviously, match)
- Allow belt to belt inserter in blueprint as long as both start and end belt are selected

### v2.1.0-Beta
- BREAKING CHANGE: Blueprint data format v2: 80% blueprint size reduction. 
- new Spherical coordinates positioning system. AMAZING work by `Kremnev8`
- General code cleanup and big performance improvements across the board
- fix bug where building of a blueprints could be placed on water if positioned outside the mecha building range 
- fix blueprint menu not closing in sail mode

### v2.0.6-Beta
- Fix some buildings (power exchanger / ejectors / lab / rayreceivers) 'recipe' not being correctly copied in blueprint mode 
- Add ability to configure spacing period in multibuild using `CTRL +` and `CTRL -`
- Add ability to toggle pasting of inserters in single and multibuild mode (not in blueprint mode) using `TAB`

### v2.0.5-Beta
- Fix unresponsive blueprint UI

### v2.0.4-Beta
- Fix an issue in blueprint mode where some buildings (tanks / fractionators / powerExchangers) were not correctly connecting to belts if the connected belt was built before the building itself
- Blueprint panel shows correct info about last stored blueprint
- Add ability to prepend blueprint strings with custom text to allow to quick identification of a stored blueprint. A `:` must terminate the custom string Example `Blueprint name:<actual blueprint string>`. The custom text, if present, will be shown in the panel info if an imported blueprint is stored.
- Change visual notification when importing/exporting from blocking popup to less intrusive realtime popup notification

### v2.0.3-Beta
- Fix an edge case issue where buildings where not copied with the correct yaw (happen if you copy an area containing belts that was created by a rotated blueprint, and the first element you select is a belt :S)
- Fix blueprint data not correctly resetting when leaviing build mode 

### v2.0.2-Beta
- Logistic station settings and slot filters are now correctly copied and pasted (not when `shift + clicking` to avoid mistakes) 
- Fix an issue where some buildings 'recipe' was not being copied (ejectors for example)

- Fix issue where connected inserters not being copied when `shift + clicking` while not in build mode

- Blueprints !!!

### v1.1.2
- Fix incompatibility issue with CopyInserters where inserters were not being copied when in multibuild mode

### v1.1.1
- Fix a bug where the build preview disappears and the game reports "building out of range", if, when in multibuild mode, only a single copy of the building is placed.

### v1.1.0
- Store spacing indipendently per item so that you can place your power poles with a different spacing than your assembler without having to constantly tap `+` and `-`. You can opt out of this functionality and revert to the hold behavious by setting the `itemSpecificSpacing` config to `false`.
- Add ability to use key `0` to reset spacing

### v1.0.2
