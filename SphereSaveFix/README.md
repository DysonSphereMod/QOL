# DSP-SphereSaveFix

This mod reduces the file size (and saving time) of your DSP games by ignoring some fields of the DysonShell model that can be recalculated from scratch at loading time. No other changes are applied to the savegame so no other objects should be affected by this optimisation.
This means that the optimisation results are only visible if you have one or more Dyson sphere with bigger benefit the higher amount of sections your sphere(s) has.

The developers will mostlikely fix this issue soon, but if your hard disk is getting full now, this is the mod for you.

Sample results:

| Original size | Optimised size |
|-|-|
| 1105 MB | 203 MB |
| 499 MB | 355 MB|
| 70 MB | 43 MB|


# WARNING !!
Backup your savegames !

I'll try to keep this mod up to date for as long as neccessary (unti the devs will fix this issue) but I can’t guarantee your use of this mod will be free from error and/or uninterrupted and I take no responsibility or liability, so far as legally possible, for any damages.

# WARNING !!
Savegames created using this mod are NOT COMPATIBLE with the vanilla game. 

Fortunately for you I've added an additional button on the save screen to allow to save in the 'native' format (including all the aforementioned useless data). This means that at any moment you should be able to load a optimised game and save it in the original format.
